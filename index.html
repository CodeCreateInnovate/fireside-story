    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    
    <p>(2)...in the middle of December. You're wearing a very warm winter jacket...</p>
    
    <h1>...But I was wearing board shorts and sitting on a beach drinking a mai thai!</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:dodgerblue;">(2)...But you're FREEZING BECAUSE YOU'RE WEARING BOARD SHORTS ON A BEACH IN 50 DEGREE WEATHER!!!! 
        You look up to the sky and sigh as a raptor (dinosaur) teleports down from the sky...</h2>
    
    <h1>Then We loaded up the dinosaur on a space x rocket and blasted it to mars with pizza to start a new colony.</h1>
    
    <h2 style>(2)...an <b>alert</b> appears on the screen as your're blasting into space! 
        <strong>OH NO!!! WE FORGOT TO ADD EXTRA FUEL TO THE TANK!</strong> I know what we can do you exclaim! 
        Before you can answer, the ship's AI begins to speak in a monotoone voice, "Yes, we can throw the raptor in the tank. 
        Get it...because fossil fuels?". The ship has a terrible sense of humor.</h2>
